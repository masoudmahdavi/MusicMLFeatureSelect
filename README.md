# ðŸŽµ Music Vibe Classifier

This project is a machine learning classifier that predicts the **vibe** or **mood** of a music track (e.g., *happy*, *sad*, *calm*, etc.) based on its audio features. Given a dataset of music features extracted from songs, the model calculates each track into one of several predefined vibe categories.
